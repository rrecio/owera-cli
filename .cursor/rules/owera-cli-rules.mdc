# Owera CLI General Rules

## Introduction
Owera CLI is an open-source, AI-powered command-line tool designed to automate web app development. It transforms user-provided app specifications into functional Flask-based web applications using AI agents for design, development, testing, and review. This document outlines the general rules, guidelines, and best practices for using Owera CLI, contributing to the project, and engaging with the community. By participating in the Owera CLI ecosystem, you agree to adhere to these rules to ensure a productive, respectful, and collaborative environment.

## 1. Usage Rules
Owera CLI is designed to streamline web app development, but users must follow these rules to ensure proper functionality and compliance with the project’s goals.

### 1.1 System Requirements
- Ensure your system meets the minimum requirements:
  - Python 3.8 or higher.
  - pip (Python package manager).
  - Git for version control.
  - Ollama for running AI models (e.g., `qwen2.5-coder:7b`).
- Verify sufficient disk space and write permissions in the output directory for generated files.

### 1.2 Installation and Setup
- Follow the installation steps outlined in the [README](README.md#installation).
- Install all required dependencies using:
  ```bash
  pip install -e .
  ```
- Configure environment variables as needed (e.g., `OWERA_SECRET_KEY`, `OWERA_MODEL`). See the [README](README.md#configuration) for details.

### 1.3 App Specification Format
- Provide app specifications in either a natural language string or YAML format, following the guidelines in the [App Specification Format Guide](README.md#app-specification-format-guide).
- Use clear, unique feature names and descriptions to avoid parsing errors.
- Specify constraints (e.g., "secure login", "use a database") explicitly to ensure correct implementation.
- Test with simple specs first to verify functionality before creating complex apps.
- When using YAML format, ensure proper syntax and structure as shown in the examples in the [README](README.md#app-specification-format-guide).

### 1.4 Generated Code Usage
- Owera CLI generates code under the MIT License, which you can use, modify, and distribute freely, provided you include the license and copyright notice.
- Review generated code for accuracy and security before deploying to production environments.
- Do not use the generated Flask development server in production; use a production WSGI server (e.g., Gunicorn) instead, as warned in the app output.

### 1.5 Limitations
- Owera CLI is in alpha and may have bugs or incomplete features (e.g., `real-time updates`, `file upload` are not yet supported).
- The tool currently supports only the default tech stack (Python/Flask, HTML/CSS with Tailwind, SQLite, JWT). Custom tech stacks may be ignored.
- Generated apps are prototypes; additional development may be required for production readiness.

## 2. Community Guidelines
The Owera CLI community is a collaborative space for users, contributors, and maintainers. These guidelines ensure a respectful and productive environment.

### 2.1 Code of Conduct
- **Be Respectful**: Treat all community members with kindness, regardless of their background, experience level, or opinions.
- **No Harassment**: Harassment, discrimination, or abusive behavior will not be tolerated, including offensive language, threats, or personal attacks.
- **Constructive Feedback**: Provide feedback respectfully and constructively, focusing on ideas and solutions rather than individuals.
- **Inclusivity**: Welcome diverse perspectives and encourage participation from all community members.

### 2.2 Communication Channels
- **Discord**: Use the official Owera CLI Discord server for community discussions, support, and collaboration.
  - Follow channel-specific rules (e.g., #support for help, #ideas-and-feedback for suggestions).
  - Do not spam or post off-topic messages.
- **GitHub Issues**: Use GitHub Issues for bug reports, feature requests, and technical discussions.
  - Search for existing issues before creating a new one.
  - Provide clear, detailed information (e.g., error logs, steps to reproduce).
- **Email**: Contact [info@owera.ai](mailto:info@owera.ai) for private inquiries, partnership opportunities, or commercial support.

### 2.3 Community Contributions
- Share your generated apps, tutorials, or case studies in the #general or #showcase channels on Discord to inspire others.
- Provide constructive feedback on Owera CLI’s features, usability, or documentation in the #ideas-and-feedback channel or via GitHub Issues.
- Respect the contributions of others and give credit where due.

## 3. Contribution Rules
Owera CLI welcomes contributions from the community to improve the tool and grow its ecosystem. These rules ensure a smooth contribution process.

### 3.1 Contribution Process
- Follow the contribution steps outlined in the [README](README.md#contributing):
  1. Fork the repository.
  2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`).
  3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m "Add your feature description"`).
  4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/your-feature-name`).
  5. Open a pull request with a detailed description.
- Ensure your pull request addresses a specific issue or feature request (link to the relevant GitHub Issue if applicable).
- Write clear commit messages and follow the project’s coding style (e.g., PEP 8 for Python).

### 3.2 Code Quality Standards
- Write clean, modular, and well-documented code.
- Include tests for new features or bug fixes where applicable.
- Ensure compatibility with the `qwen2.5-coder:7b` model used by Ollama.
- Avoid breaking changes to existing functionality; discuss major changes in a GitHub Issue first.

### 3.3 Contributor License Agreement (CLA)
- By contributing to Owera CLI, you agree to license your contributions under the MIT License.
- Contributions may be relicensed for commercial purposes (e.g., for a hosted API or premium features). You retain copyright to your work but grant Owera CLI maintainers the right to use, modify, and distribute it.

### 3.4 Review Process

- Significant contributions may earn you a “Contributor” role on Discord and a feature in the “Owera CLI Chronicles” blog series.

## 4. Commercial Use Rules
Owera CLI supports commercial use under the MIT License, with additional guidelines for businesses.

### 4.1 Free Usage
- Businesses can use Owera CLI to generate, modify, and deploy web apps for free, provided they comply with the MIT License terms (include the license and copyright notice in distributions).
