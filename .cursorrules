# CursorRules for owera-cli and generated Flask projects

[General]
# Use these rules to help Cursor understand project structure, navigation, and safe editing practices.

[Ignore]
# Ignore generated or temporary files and directories
__pycache__/
*.pyc
*.pyo
*.log
*.sqlite3
*.db
*.egg-info/
dist/

logs/
.env

# Ignore test artifacts and deleted files
shopeasy/tests/
shopeasy/templates/
shopeasy/src/routes.py

[Navigation]
# Main CLI entrypoint
owera/cli.py

# Core models and agents
owera/models/
owera/agents/
owera/generator/

# Configuration and environment
owera/config.py
owera/models/base.py

# Generated project structure (example: shopeasy)
shopeasy/app.py
shopeasy/models.py
shopeasy/routes.py
shopeasy/templates/
shopeasy/static/

[BestPractices]
# Always use the CLI to generate new projects or features, do not manually edit generated files unless necessary.
# When updating template or route naming conventions, ensure consistency across all agents and the code generator.
# Regenerate the project after making changes to the code generator or agent logic.
# Use editable installs (`pip install -e .`) for local development of the owera package.
# Ensure the logs directory exists before running the CLI or generated apps.
# When debugging Flask errors, check for:
#   - Duplicate app instances or route decorators
#   - Template naming mismatches
#   - Missing or misnamed templates in the templates/ directory

[Testing]
# Place all tests in the tests/ directory of the generated project.
# Use pytest for running tests.
# Remove or ignore test files if not needed in production.

[Conventions]
# Template files should use lowercase names without underscores (e.g., home.html, productlist.html).
# All agents and the code generator must use the same naming conventions for templates and routes.
# Environment variables should be managed via owera/config.py and .env files.

[DoNotEdit]
# Do not manually edit files in owera/agents/ unless you are updating agent logic.
# Do not edit generated files in shopeasy/ except for debugging or extending features.
